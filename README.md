# Bitcoin_App

This is a simple jQuery project that makes an AJAX request to a third party API that contains historical prices of Bitcoin in US Dollars. 

The user will be asked for a date in history and a dollar amount for a hypothetical past investment in Bitcoin. 

The app then requests the historical price of Bitcoin at that date and then processes the data to show what that hypothetical investment would be worth today.

You'll be surprised at the results! Have a try: http://got-bitcoin.bitballoon.com/
